## About Me

I am 22 years old; currently I'm working as a system administrator. I'm getting way to tired of the communications with my colleagues, so I'm thinking of switching to coding. As far as I'm aware, most of your work doesn't need constant communication with colleagues.

* **My strengths:**
    * Quick learner
    * Diligence
    * Searching and analytic skills
> *Classic' â€“ a book which people praise and don't read.*
